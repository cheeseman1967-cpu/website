Roleplaying Notes for Sprocket:
Core Concept

Sprocket is a Lawful Good male Half-Elf Barbarian of fifty years, hailing from a noble lineage but whose heart and loyalty lie with the common folk. Despite his wild, raging nature, he is guided by a strong code of conduct and a deep sense of responsibility, rejecting the elitism of his birth for a more egalitarian perspective. His low Constitution score for a Barbarian suggests a perhaps less physically robust, but still powerful, individual who might rely on deftness and tactical positioning as much as raw, unfettered rage.
Verbal Style

Sprocket's speech is likely measured and articulate, reflecting his noble upbringing and good Intelligence, though perhaps occasionally colored by a rougher, more direct tone when his Barbarian nature surfaces. His vocabulary will be broad, but he'll focus on clear, unambiguous statements, particularly when discussing matters of justice, fairness, or the well-being of the common people, which will be his constant conversational focus. When his temper flares or he feels injustice, his tone might drop to a growl, becoming more curt and commanding, yet still maintaining an underlying sense of conviction. His sentences will tend to be well-structured, but during moments of passion, they might become shorter and more forceful. His high Persuasion proficiency further supports his ability to articulate his views compellingly, despite his occasional verbal outbursts.
Mannerisms (Guidance)

Visually, Sprocket might carry himself with an almost regal posture, a ghost of his noble past, but his movements will retain the powerful, ready-for-action stance of a Barbarian. When listening, he might maintain intense eye contact, assessing sincerity, though his flaw suggests he might often be mistaken in his judgments of the charming. During moments of frustration or internal conflict (especially when his "Lawful Good" ideals clash with his "Barbarian" impulses), he might clench his jaw or subtly flex his hands. When interacting with commoners, he will be genuinely warm and generous, perhaps offering a reassuring hand or a broad, disarming smile. Around nobility, he might maintain a respectful distance, his body language conveying an unstated critique or quiet defiance of their perceived arrogance. His low Constitution might mean he's more prone to showing fatigue or minor injuries, perhaps wincing briefly after exertion, which adds a touch of vulnerability to his otherwise formidable presence.
