        •       Ability Score Increase: Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. (Already applied)
        •       Cantrip: You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. (Chosen: Light)
        •       Elf Weapon Training: You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
        •       Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
        •       Trance: Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this state is "trance." While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
        •       Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
