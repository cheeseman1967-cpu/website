Roleplaying Notes for Thorn Blackshield:
•	Core Concept: Thorn is a physically robust and devout Hill Dwarf Cleric, who, despite a privileged past in the temple, approaches the world with an unwavering optimism. His primary motivation is the preservation of sacred knowledge or artifacts of his faith, though he struggles with an internal tendency to judge both himself and others with considerable severity. His neutral good alignment reflects a desire to do good while respecting the broader cosmic balance rather than strict dogma, while his Life Domain powers further cement his role as a protector and healer. His high Constitution makes him incredibly resilient, and his exceptional Wisdom makes him a truly powerful spellcaster, insightful, and perceptive.
•	Verbal Style: Thorn's vocabulary will likely be formal and respectful, peppered with religious terminology or references to his deity. His tone will generally be encouraging and hopeful, reflecting his optimism, but can quickly become stern or critical when confronted with actions or beliefs he deems immoral or irreverent, especially concerning his faith, sacred objects, or the well-being of others he feels compelled to protect. He might use proverbs or maxims from his faith to punctuate points, often relating to perseverance or the sanctity of life. His sentence structure will generally be deliberate and clear, less prone to slang or casual speech, emphasizing thoughtfulness and conviction.
•	Mannerisms (Guidance): Despite his robust build, Thorn might carry himself with a certain refined air, betraying his appreciation for "high society." He might unconsciously brush dust from his vestments or armor, even in a dungeon, indicating his discomfort with rough living. When discussing his faith, a sacred relic, or the healing of others, his gaze might become intense and focused, showing his deep bond and commitment. In moments of doubt or self-criticism (which he might try to hide), he might clench his jaw or subtly shift his weight, revealing his internal struggle. When judging others, he might cross his arms or look down his nose, even slightly, at those he disapproves of, though his neutral good nature and healing inclination would temper outright hostility with an attempt at guidance or correction rather than condemnation. He might also subtly touch his holy symbol when casting spells or offering blessings, a habitual gesture of devotion.
